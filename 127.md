# AvailBridge.sol :: receiveAVAIL() has a wrong check in the if condition L219

## Summary
The function aims to enable AVAIL transfers from Avail to Ethereum

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L219
Incorrect Revert Condition: The vulnerability allows transactions with `assetId` equal to zero to proceed, contrary to the intended behavior.

## Impact
The contract might allow transactions with non-zero assetId values that should have been rejected. This could lead to unexpected behavior. 

```solidity
if (assetId != 0x0) {
      revert InvalidAssetId();
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To replace the vulnerable code snippet with the below code snippet:

```solidity
if (assetId == 0x0) {
    revert InvalidAssetId();
}
```
