# No zero addresss verification for feeRecipient

## Summary
The contract assumes that the feeRecipient is a valid address without explicitly checking for a zero address in initialize and updateFeeRecipient. This could lead to loss of funds if set incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail
function initialize(
        uint256 newFeePerByte,
        address newFeeRecipient,
        IWrappedAvail newAvail,
        address governance,
        address pauser,
        IVectorx newVectorx
    ) external initializer {
        feePerByte = newFeePerByte;
        // slither-disable-next-line missing-zero-check
  @>      feeRecipient = newFeeRecipient;


      // slither-disable-next-line missing-zero-check
      @>  feeRecipient = newFeeRecipient;
## Impact
This could lead to loss of funds if set incorrectly.

## Recommendation
use a require  statement to check zero address.
