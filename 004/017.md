# Access Control (General Best Practice)

## Summary
The contract uses a custom access control mechanism, allowing only messages from availBridge. Ensuring robust implementation is crucial.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inadequate access control can lead to unauthorized actions, potentially compromising contract security and leading to asset loss or manipulation.

## Impact
Weak or bypassed access controls can allow attackers to call sensitive functions, leading to unauthorized actions or fund misappropriation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Utilize established patterns or libraries for access management and ensure availBridge is securely managed and updated if necessary.
The availBridge address should be securely set and managed to ensure that the access control is effective.
