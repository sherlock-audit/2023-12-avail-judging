# THERE IS NO LOGIC IN THE `AvailBridge` CONTRACT TO WITHDRAW THE LOCKED FUNDS, IN THE EVENT, THE CONTRACT IS PAUSED DUE TO AN EMERGENCY

## Summary

There is no logic implementation to withdraw the locked funds from the `AvailBridge` contract when the contract is paused due to an emergency thus locking the user funds in the contract till the vulnerability is resolved and bridge is `unpaused`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `AvailBridge` contract stores the `native eth` and the `transferred ERC20 toknes` via the bridge in the contract. The `AvaildBridge` has the `pause` functionality to pause the contract (to pause the transfer of assets and messages) in the event of an emergency. 

But the issue is there is no mechanism to withdraw the `native eth` and `erc20 tokens` stuck in the `AvailBridge` contract when the contract is paused in the event of an emergency.

## Impact

Hence if the contract bridge is exploited in a way that it can not be `immediately unpaused` the user funds will be locked till the `AvailBridge` is upgraded and `unpuased`. This would create opportunity cost for the users of the `AvailBridge` since if they recieved thier funds as soon as the `AvailBridge` was `paused` they could have used those funds for other meaningful uses case. And add to that this would damage the reputation of the `AvailBridge` protocol as well since the user confidence will be hampered.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function setPaused(bool status) external onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE) {
        if (status) {
            _pause();
        } else {
            _unpause();
        }
    }
```

## Tool used
VSCode and Manual Review

## Recommendation

Hence it is recommended to add an emergency withdrawal function logic in the `AvailBridge` contract which only the governance can call to withdraw the funds (native eth and erc20 tokens) locked in the `AvailBridge` contract and transfer them to the respective users, when the contract is paused due to an emergency. This will further require to implement `mappings` to store the `user address` and their respective `deposit amounts` in the `AvailBridge` contract for the refunding.
