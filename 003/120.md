# Merkle leaf values for `dataRootCommitment` are 64 bytes before hashing which can lead to merkle tree collisions

## Summary
AvailBridge hashes 64 bytes when calculating leaf allowing it to collide with the internal nodes of the Merkle tree.
## Vulnerability Detail
The hash value of 64 bytes of `blobRoot` and `bridgeRoot` is used as a leaf node in the function `AvailBridge.sol#_checkDataRoot()`.  Both `blobRoot` and `bridgeRoot` passed by the user are uint256 (32 bytes each for 64 bytes total), while the parent data that is hashed is also 64 bytes. As a result, it is possible to have a hash collision between a leaf and any node in the tree. This allows for proofs to be repeated multiple times by taking subtrees as leaves.
```solidity
    function _checkDataRoot(MerkleProofInput calldata input) private view {
        bytes32 dataRootCommitment = vectorx.dataRootCommitments(input.rangeHash);
        if (dataRootCommitment == 0x0) {
            revert DataRootCommitmentEmpty();
        }
        // we construct the data root here internally, it is not possible to create an invalid data root that is
        // also part of the commitment tree
        if (
            !input.dataRootProof.verify(
                dataRootCommitment, input.dataRootIndex, keccak256(abi.encode(input.blobRoot, input.bridgeRoot))
            )
        ) {
            revert InvalidDataRootProof();
        }
    }
```

## Impact
The public/external function `verifyBlobLeaf()` and `verifyBridgeLeaf()` calling `_checkDataRoot()` may return true with invalid input, which may bring unexpected errors.

## Recommendation
Use a combination of variables that don't sum to 64 bytes, for example, using `encodePacked` to combine `blobRoot` and `bridgeRoot`.
