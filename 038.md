# Contract Upgradeability and Initialization

## Summary
As an Initializable contract, ensuring that the contract is properly initialized and preventing re-initialization is crucial for maintaining the contract's integrity.
## Vulnerability Detail
If the initialization mechanism has flaws or if the contract can be re-initialized, it might lead to security issues like resetting critical state variables or changing the contract's behavior.
## Impact
Improper initialization or re-initialization can lead to setting incorrect addresses for availBridge or other critical parameters, impacting the contract's behavior.
## Code Snippet

The __MessageReceiver_init function is intended to initialize the contract.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. **Ensure Proper Initialization**: Make sure that the contract is properly initialized upon deployment and that the initialization logic correctly sets up all necessary state variables.
2. **Protect Against Re-initialization**: Ensure that the contract cannot be re-initialized once deployed, which could potentially reset its state or configuration.
