# Very large sends from AvailBridge will break receiving bridge and cause loss of funds

## Summary

When sending tokens, up to uint256.max can be sent by AvailBridge, however lib.rs can only receive amounts up to uint128.max. Any values over uint128.max will cause the AVAIL side of the bridge to panic and deposit will be permanently lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

[lib.rs#L394-L399](https://github.com/availproject/avail/blob/e976c560ee3f8c7d36d9fbec8e98c29283f1aa34/pallets/succinct/src/lib.rs#L394-L399)

    T::Currency::transfer(
            &Self::account_id(),
            &destination_account_id,
            amount.as_u128().saturated_into(),
            ExistenceRequirement::AllowDeath,
    )?;

When receiving a token transfer, lib.rs attempts to convert the amount from uint256 to uint128 via `as_u128()`. When amount is more than uint128.max this will panic and prevent processing of the transaction. Since the bridge doesn't have any way handle failed transactions, the deposit will be permanently lost.

## Impact

Large deposits will break the receiving end of the bridge and cause loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Cause all `send` functions to revert for amounts that are greater than uint128.max.
