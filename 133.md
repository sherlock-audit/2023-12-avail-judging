# the nonce value doesnt increace and its always == 1

## Summary
the nonce value doesn't increase and its always == 1
## Vulnerability Detail
in the contract `Availbridge.sol` one of the examples of broken increment is happening in L331 function `sendAVAIL` 
```solidity 
   uint256 id;
        unchecked {
            id = messageId++;
        }
```

imagine number of the messageif which is nonce is 0 and then this id in the function tries to increase but what happens is because the original value of `messageid` never increases the id is always going to be same like 1 if it 0 and everytime user calling these functions which this logic is used in manny functions of this project the `id`  is going to be 1(same previous on) and then the whole messages will send over this id and its going to break the functionality of the nonce 

  `// nonce
        uint64 messageId;
    }`
so it actually means that the nonce is broken in whole contract and because of these logics it keeps giving previous values which is not a valid `nonce`. 
## Impact
nonce logic is broken and will not give a valid nonce values which is dangerous.
## Code Snippet
[function sendAVAIL(bytes32 recipient, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused checkDestAmt(recipient, amount) {](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/1afb56b8d4dfbf5d3f21bed0ddf80a04730204b5/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L329-L349)
```solidity 
function sendAVAIL(bytes32 recipient, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused checkDestAmt(recipient, amount) {
        uint256 id;
        unchecked {
            id = messageId++;
        }
        Message memory message = Message(
            TOKEN_TX_PREFIX,
            bytes32(bytes20(msg.sender)),
            recipient,
            ETH_DOMAIN,
            AVAIL_DOMAIN,
            abi.encode(bytes32(0), amount),
            uint64(id)
        );
        // store message hash to be retrieved later by our light client
        isSent[id] = keccak256(abi.encode(message));

        emit MessageSent(msg.sender, recipient, id);

        avail.burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }

```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- consider increasing nonce `messageid` instead of id uint
