# Not requiring approvals for wAVAIL bridges make the token dangerous in some existing defi platforms

## Summary

When burning tokens there is no allowance check that the bridge has been approved by the from address to allow that burn to happen. This causes issue with certain defi protocols. It is common across other protocols to allow users to make arbitrary calls with certain selectors blacklisted, typically transfer, transferFrom and approve, since those are the only functions on a standard ERC20 token that can cause balances to change. By allowing the bridge to burn tokens without approval, this creates an additional way for tokens to be transferred. For protocols that implement this pattern wAVAIL can be bridged directly without the need for approval and stolen.

## Vulnerability Detail

[WrappedAvail.sol#L34-L36](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/WrappedAvail.sol#L34-L36)

    function burn(address from, uint256 amount) external onlyAvailBridge {
        _burn(from, amount);
    }

As stated above, burn does not require any approval leading to the issue described above.

## Impact

wAVAIL can be exploited in some existing defi protocols

## Recommendation

Require and consume approval from `from` to `AvailBridge` when burning tokens.
