# potential theft of bridges fee due to poor withdrawal design

## Summary
`withdrawFees` is callable by anyone

## Vulnerability Detail
`withdrawFees` is a sensitive function in the protocol as it withdraws `fees` from the bridge to the supposed `feeRecipient`
Irrespective of the design, This function is an extremely sensitive part of the protocol, it shouldnt be accessible or callable by anyone

## Impact
### POSSIBLE SCENARIO
- The EOA balance is empty or contains an insignificant amount currently
- Attacker got hold of EOA control, possibly from phishing or something similar
- Attacker calls the `withdrawFees` function and steals away the whole accumulated fees of the bridge
- If the withdrawal function isnt publicly accessible, this wont have resolved in theft of bridge fees

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- make the `withdrawFees` function only callable by authorized personnels i.e admin or the bridge
- For convienece sake, you can make use of keeper bots with authorized permissions to withdraw this fee periodically
