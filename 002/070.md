# Fees can be burned due to allowing feeRecipient to be address 0

## Summary
The [withdrawFees()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L171) function in the AvailBridge smart contract, callable by anyone, poses a vulnerability that allows malicious actors to intentionally burn accumulated fees. This risk arises when the **feeRecipient** is set to address(0) using the updateFeeRecipient() function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [withdrawFees()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L171) function lacks a proper check on the **feeRecipient** address, enabling any user, including malicious actors, to deliberately call the function when **feeRecipient** is set to address(0). This results in the burning of fees, as they are sent to an unrecoverable address.

## Impact
Malicious actors can intentionally trigger withdrawFees() when **feeRecipient** is set to address(0), leading to the deliberate burning of accumulated fees. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function withdrawFees() external {
        uint256 fee = fees;
        delete fees;
        // @audit fees can be burned if called when **feeRecipient** is not set
        // slither-disable-next-line low-level-calls
        (bool success, ) = feeRecipient.call{value: fee}("");
        if (!success) {
            revert WithdrawFailed();
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, implement a check in the withdrawFees() function to ensure that only a valid (non-zero) feeRecipient can receive fee. Additionally, enhance the updateFeeRecipient() function to disallow setting address(0) as the fee recipient, preventing intentional fee burning by malicious actors.
```solidity
function withdrawFees() external {
    require(feeRecipient != address(0), "Invalid feeRecipient");
    uint256 fee = fees;
    delete fees;
    (bool success, ) = feeRecipient.call{value: fee}("");
    if (!success) {
        revert WithdrawFailed();
    }
}

function updateFeeRecipient(address newFeeRecipient) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    require(newFeeRecipient != address(0), "Invalid feeRecipient");
    feeRecipient = newFeeRecipient;
}

```
