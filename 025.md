# AvailBridge::sendERC20() could face impact due to admin updating the assetId to Token address mapping.

## Summary
sendERC20 generates an encoded message and stored it in isSent map to be processed by light client.
In the message itself, the assetId is stored, but not the actual token address. 

With Admin's ability to update the token to assetId mapping, there is a potential for failure to process these stored message in isSent map, either due to

a)  incorrect token mapping to assetId
b)  the new contract address does not have sufficient balance or there is a difference in implementation of the replaced contract.
     There will be state in the old contract and if that state is not reflected in the new contract, it could bring out reasons for failure.

## Vulnerability Detail
Asset Id to Token Address is critical for processing of queued messages. As the admin has ability to replace the tokenAddress for an assetId with new one,  since many of these operations are tied users and their balances, replacement of token address with new one may impact the processing of the queued messages in isSent map.

## Impact
Some of the message stored in isSent map may not get processed due to data migration issues between old and new contracts for the asset id.

## Code Snippet
Functionality available to admin to process update the assetId to token address mapping.

The message in the queue knows only the assetId to operate on. If admin replaces it will new address,  it may impact the processing of the message due to 

a) incorrect token address
b) new token address does not have sufficient balance in the sender's account to transfer funds.

```solidity
Message memory message = Message(
            TOKEN_TX_PREFIX,
            bytes32(bytes20(msg.sender)),
            recipient,
            ETH_DOMAIN,
            AVAIL_DOMAIN,
            abi.encode(assetId, amount),
            uint64(id)
        );
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Keep the token address as part of message hash so that the queued message operates on the old token address.
Admin can update the new token address which will start to apply for the newly queued messages.
