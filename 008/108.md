# `AvailBridge.receiveETH` FUNCTION DOES NOT PERFORM INPUT VALIDAITON CHECK ON RECIPIENT ADDRESS FOR `address(0)` THUS COULD LEAD TO LOSS OF FUNDS

## Summary

The `AvailBridge.receiveETH` function lacks input validation check for `dest` address (recipient) for native eth transfers, thus leading to loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `AvailBridge.receiveETH` function is used for `ETH transfers from Avail to Ethereum`.  Initially the `message` is verified against the `merkle proof input` and if succesful then the value is transferred to the `dest` address as shown below:

        (bool success,) = dest.call{value: value}(""); //@audit-info - send the eth value to the destination
        if (!success) { //@audit-issue - no check on `message.to != address(0)` and `value != 0`
            revert UnlockFailed();
        }

But the issue here is that there is no input validation check for the `dest` address for `address(0)`.

## Impact

Hence if the `recipient` address passed in from the `message` is address(0) the funds transferred via the `low-level` call function will be lost. 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function receiveETH(Message calldata message, MerkleProofInput calldata input)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        onlySupportedDomain(message.originDomain, message.destinationDomain)
        onlyTokenTransfer(message.messageType)
        nonReentrant
    {
        (bytes32 assetId, uint256 value) = abi.decode(message.data, (bytes32, uint256));
        if (assetId != ETH_ASSET_ID) {
            revert InvalidAssetId();
        }

        _checkBridgeLeaf(message, input);

        // downcast SCALE-encoded bytes to an Ethereum address
        address dest = address(bytes20(message.to));

        emit MessageReceived(message.from, dest, message.messageId);

        // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-eth,missing-zero-check,low-level-calls
        (bool success,) = dest.call{value: value}("");
        if (!success) {
            revert UnlockFailed();
        }
    }
```

VSCode and Manual Review

## Recommendation

Hence it is recommended to add an input validation check for `dest` address in the `AvailBridge.receiveETH` function before the native eth is transferred. And the transaction should revert if the `dest` address is `address(0)`. Furthermore it is recommended to add an input validation check for the `value` variable to verify it is `!=0`.
