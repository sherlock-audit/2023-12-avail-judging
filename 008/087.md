# receiveETH could spend fee

## Summary
The receiveETH function in the AvailBridge contract currently allows the possibility of send fees, which contradicts the intended behavior. The absence of proper fee checking can result in users obtaining the entire value sent to receiveETH, leading to an accumulation of fees that cannot be utilized.

## Vulnerability Detail
Contrary to the expected behavior, the receiveETH function lacks sufficient checks to prevent the spending of fees. Users could potentially receive the full value of the Ether sent to receiveETH, even if there are associated fees. This oversight poses a risk to the proper functioning of fee management within the contract.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that fees could be collected through the receiveETH function, but the corresponding withdrawFees mechanism might be unable to utilize these fees. This situation could lead to a discrepancy between the accumulated fees and their actual usability, impacting the expected financial flow within the AvailBridge contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review and wrote a simple test

## Recommendation
Change receiveEth

```diff
function receiveETH(Message calldata message, MerkleProofInput calldata input)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        onlySupportedDomain(message.originDomain, message.destinationDomain)
        onlyTokenTransfer(message.messageType)
        nonReentrant
    {
        (bytes32 assetId, uint256 value) = abi.decode(message.data, (bytes32, uint256));
        if (assetId != ETH_ASSET_ID) {
            revert InvalidAssetId();
        }
        
+++ require(address(this).balance - value >= fees);
        
        _checkBridgeLeaf(message, input);

        // downcast SCALE-encoded bytes to an Ethereum address
        address dest = address(bytes20(message.to));

        emit MessageReceived(message.from, dest, message.messageId);

        // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-eth,missing-zero-check,low-level-calls
        (bool success,) = dest.call{value: value}("");
        if (!success) {
            revert UnlockFailed();
        }
    }
```
