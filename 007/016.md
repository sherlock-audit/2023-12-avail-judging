# Proper Initialization in Constructor (General Best Practice)

## Summary
The contract's constructor sets the bridge address without validating it, potentially leading to misconfiguration.

## Vulnerability Detail
The constructor of the WrappedAvail contract sets the bridge address directly based on the input parameter. There's no check to ensure that the provided address is not the zero address, which is a common practice to prevent misconfiguration. Setting an incorrect bridge address, especially the zero address, can render the mint and burn functions unusable or, in worse scenarios, compromise the contract's security by allowing unauthorized access to these critical functions.

## Impact
Setting the bridge address to an incorrect value can lead to a locked state or unauthorized access, depending on the contract's design and other security measures in place. This can lead to loss of funds or inability to manage the tokens as intended.

## Recommendation
Implement a check in the constructor to ensure that the _bridge address is not the zero address. Properly validate input parameters to prevent misconfiguration and potential contract dysfunction.
