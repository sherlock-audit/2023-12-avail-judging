# Excess funds are lost when using sendMessage

## Summary

`sendMessage` is used to bridge a transaction of arbitrary data to a given recipient. A fee is calculated but if excess Ether is sent, it will not be returned.

## Vulnerability Detail

The user can send an arbitrary amount of Ether to `sendMessage` and there is a single check to determine that it exceeds the required fee. No excess is returned.

## Impact
Since `onAvailMessage` is not payable, it is assumed that the recipient does not get these funds with the message. The sender will pay a higher fee for no apparent reason.

```solidity
function sendMessage(bytes32 recipient, bytes calldata data) external payable whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = data.length;
        if (length >= MAX_DATA_LENGTH) {
            revert ExceedsMaxDataLength();
        }
        // ensure that fee is above minimum amount
        if (msg.value < getFee(length)) {
            revert FeeTooLow();
        }
        uint256 id;
        unchecked {
            id = messageId++;
        }
        fees += msg.value;
        Message memory message = Message(
            MESSAGE_TX_PREFIX, bytes32(bytes20(msg.sender)), recipient, ETH_DOMAIN, AVAIL_DOMAIN, data, uint64(id)
        );
        // store message hash to be retrieved later by our light client
        isSent[id] = keccak256(abi.encode(message));

        emit MessageSent(msg.sender, recipient, id);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Calculate the excess fee paid and return it.
