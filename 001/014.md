# Potential loss of ETH in form of fees when sending message in AvailBridge

## Summary
When sending message via `sendMessage ()` function, users are subjected to a fee which is calculated by calling `getFee(length)` whose implementation is as follows:
```Solidity
    function getFee(uint256 length) public view returns (uint256) {
        return length * feePerByte;
    }
```
`feePerByte` can be updated by the contract governance via `updateFeePerByte` function as
```Solidity
    function updateFeePerByte(uint256 newFeePerByte) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        feePerByte = newFeePerByte;
    }
```
Now, a scenario where a user wants to send a message and calls the `sendMessage ()` function and the governor updates the `feePerByte` by calling `updateFeePerByte` function and the governors transaction is added to the block in front of the user's call, the user would have to pay the updated fee. This would result, either for the user's call to revert because the fee would be more than the `msg.value` or users will have to use `msg.value` higher than the fee. Either way, there would be some sort of loss to a user as the contract would either revert or they will pay more. The contract should cache the fee the user is to pay, then use the cache amount instead of directly reading the fee via `getFee(length)`
The entire code can be refactored as 
```Solidity
    function sendMessage(bytes32 recipient, bytes calldata data) external payable whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = data.length;
        if (length >= MAX_DATA_LENGTH) {
            revert ExceedsMaxDataLength();
        }
        uint256 cacheFee = getFee(length);
        // ensure that fee is above minimum amount
        if (msg.value < cacheFee) { //@audit excess fee is not refunded
            revert FeeTooLow(); //@audit should store fee then call getFee
        }
        uint256 id;
        unchecked {
            id = messageId++;
        }
        fees += msg.value;
        Message memory message = Message(
            MESSAGE_TX_PREFIX, bytes32(bytes20(msg.sender)), recipient, ETH_DOMAIN, AVAIL_DOMAIN, data, uint64(id)
        );
        // store message hash to be retrieved later by our light client
        isSent[id] = keccak256(abi.encode(message));

        emit MessageSent(msg.sender, recipient, id);
    }

```
