# Overpayed fees are not refunded to user resulting in loss of funds for the user

## Summary
In the AvailBalance.sol::sendMessage(), when user send more than the fees, the remaining eth after fees is not refunded to the user
## Vulnerability Detail
AvailBalance.sol::sendMessage() accepts fees in native ETH, but does not return overpayments of the fees to the user. Overpayments are likely to occur since the function only checks if msg.value is lesser than the fee.

However, the function does not refunds the user in the case of overpayment, instead the overpayment account accrue in the contract balance

Scenerio:
Alice calls the AvailBalance::sendMessage() and sends 0.9 eth as intended fee

The getfee calculates 0.5eth to be fee and the function does not revert as msg.value is greater that 0.5 eth

The remaining 0.4eth is not refunded to the user and it accrues on the contract balance
## Impact
overpayed fees are not refunded to user which result in loss of eth for the user

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate and refund overpayment amounts to callers. This can be done by removing fee from msg.sender and after message is sent, refunded the user with the remaining amount
