# Wrong check in sendMessage()

## Summary
The [sendMessage()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L300) function in the AvailBridge smart contract encounters data length validation issue, causing transaction failures when the length is equal to MAX_DATA_LENGTH. The current check prevents valid transactions with data of the maximum allowed length.

## Vulnerability Detail
Same as summary

## Impact
Transactions with data length equal to MAX_DATA_LENGTH are incorrectly rejected, leading to unnecessary failures.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        if (length >= MAX_DATA_LENGTH) {
            revert ExceedsMaxDataLength();
        }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the data length validation condition to allow transactions with data length up to and including MAX_DATA_LENGTH. Update the check as follows:
```solidity
if (length > MAX_DATA_LENGTH) {
    revert ExceedsMaxDataLength();
}
```
