# Addressing Insufficient Balance Checks in Token Transfer Functions

## Summary
The contract's token transfer functions currently lack crucial balance checks, posing potential risks:

sendAVAIL Function:

Issue: Missing balance check before burning AVAIL tokens.
Fix: Introduce a check to ensure sufficient AVAIL balance before initiating the burn.
sendETH Function:

Issue: Absence of a balance check before ETH transfer.
Fix: Implement a check to confirm adequate ETH balance before initiating the transfer.
sendERC20 Function:

Issue: No check for sufficient ERC20 token balance before transfer.
Fix: Add a balance check to verify ample ERC20 token balance before initiating the transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail
sendAVAIL Function:
Issue: Lack of a check to ensure the contract has sufficient AVAIL balance before attempting to burn tokens.
Recommendation: Add a balance check before burning AVAIL tokens.
Proposed Fix:
if (avail.balanceOf(address(this)) < amount) {
    revert InsufficientAVAILBalance();
}
avail.burn(address(this), amount);

sendETH Function:
Issue: Absence of a check to ensure the contract has sufficient ETH balance before attempting to transfer.
Recommendation: Include a balance check before transferring ETH.
Proposed Fix:
if (address(this).balance < value) {
    revert InsufficientETHBalance();
}
(bool success,) = payable(recipient).call{value: value}("");
if (!success) {
    revert UnlockFailed();
}

sendERC20 Function:
Issue: Missing check to ensure the contract has sufficient balance of the specified ERC20 token before attempting to transfer.
Recommendation: Integrate a balance check before transferring ERC20 tokens.
Proposed Fix:
if (IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) < amount) {
    revert InsufficientTokenBalance();
}
IERC20(token).safeTransfer(recipient, amount);

## Impact
Failure to implement these checks could result in the contract failing to transfer tokens or ETH, potentially leading to exceptions and failed transactions.
