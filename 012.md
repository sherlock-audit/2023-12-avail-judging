# Pragma Version (SWC-103)

## Summary
The contract specifies a floating pragma (^0.8.23), potentially leading to inconsistencies due to different compiler versions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The use of a floating pragma means that the contract is not tied to a specific compiler version, but rather to a range of versions (>=0.8.23 <0.9.0). This can lead to non-deterministic behavior in the contract's compilation process. Different compiler versions may introduce subtle changes in the generated bytecode, optimizations, and even the way Solidity code is interpreted. These differences can lead to contract behavior that is inconsistent or varies between environments. In the worst case, it could introduce vulnerabilities if a particular compiler version has a bug that affects the contract's code.

## Impact
Contracts compiled with different compiler versions may behave inconsistently, making them harder to verify and potentially leading to vulnerabilities if newer compiler versions introduce bugs or change the contract's execution behavior in unexpected ways.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Lock the pragma to a specific compiler version (e.g., pragma solidity 0.8.23;) to ensure consistency in the contract's compilation. Regularly update and thoroughly test with newer compiler versions in a controlled environment before deploying.
