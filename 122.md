# assets might be stuck in the AvailBridge

## Summary
assets might be stuck in the `AvailBridge.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail
In `AvailBridge.sol`, the contract doesn't record the amount of ETH/ERC20 should be crossed, if the dest chain fails to receive ETH/ERC20, the ETH/ERC20 transferred in the src chain will be lost.

## Impact
In `AvailBridge.sol`, while transfer ETH/ERC20 to `dest`, if the dest can't handle the ETH/ERC20, the ETH/ERC20 will be stucked.

## Code Snippet
I will take [AvailBridge.receiveETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L239-L263) as an example to demonstrate, ERC20 has the same issue.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L238-L263

In above code, while the contract fails to transfer ETH, the function will [emit a event](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L259-L262)

**But in the event, there is no information about the amount of ETH being sent.**

On the other hand, when looking into `AvailBridge.sendETH`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L355-L374
**The contract doesn't record the amount of ETH be sent too**

So if [dest fails to receive ETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L259-L262), the protocol doesn't know the amount of the ETH to refund to the `msg.sender` even he wants.
