# low-level call to transfer ETH

## Summary
The withdrawFees function uses a low-level call to transfer ETH, which can be risky if the recipient is a contract with a fallback function. It's generally safer to use transfer or send with a fixed gas limit.

## Vulnerability Detail
  (bool success,) = feeRecipient.call{value: fee}("");
        if (!success) {
            revert WithdrawFailed();

 (bool success,) = dest.call{value: value}("");
        if (!success) {
            revert UnlockFailed();
        }
## Impact
 which can be risky if the recipient is a contract with a fallback function. It's generally safer to use transfer or send with a fixed gas limit.
