# `sendMessage()` Allow Spamming of Off-Chain Infrastructure

## Summary
The `sendMessage` function lacks a check for zero-length data. Unlike the `sendAVAIL` and `sendETH` functions, which have safeguards against zero token amounts, `sendMessage` does not prevent the sending of messages with empty data. This oversight could allow attackers to spam the off-chain infrastructure without incurring any fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `sendMessage` function, the only check performed on the `data` parameter is whether its length exceeds `MAX_DATA_LENGTH`. However, there is no check to ensure that the `data` is not empty. This could be exploited by sending a large number of empty messages, potentially leading to spamming of the network's off-chain components. Since the fee calculation (`getFee(length)`) is based on the length of the data, a zero-length message would not attract any fees, making it a vector for spam attacks.

## Impact
This vulnerability allows attackers to spam the off-chain infrastructure without paying any fee.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add a check for zero-length `data` in the `sendMessage` function:
```solidity
    function sendMessage(bytes32 recipient, bytes calldata data) external payable whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = data.length;
        if (length == 0 || length >= MAX_DATA_LENGTH) {        
        // ... existing code ...
    }
```
