# Denial of Service: Empty data payloads in `AvailBridge#sendMessage` can be used to inflate baseline maintenance costs for bridge maintainers.

## Summary

Empty `data` payloads skirt transmission fees when calling [`sendMessage(bytes32,bytes)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/1afb56b8d4dfbf5d3f21bed0ddf80a04730204b5/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L300).

An attacker can exploit this by deploying two contracts which recursively invoke cross-chain messages at expense of the Avail network via the implementation of an [`onAvailMessage(bytes32,bytes)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/MessageReceiver.sol#L31) callback, leading to elevated baseline network congestion and malicious permanent inflation of bridge maintenance costs.

## Vulnerability Detail

When computing the cost for an arbitrary message transfer, the length of the [`data`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/1afb56b8d4dfbf5d3f21bed0ddf80a04730204b5/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L300) parameter is used to compute the required `msg.value` for the transaction:

```solidity
// ensure that fee is above minimum amount
if (msg.value < getFee(length)) {
    revert FeeTooLow();
}
```

This is calculated using the [`getFee(uint256)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/1afb56b8d4dfbf5d3f21bed0ddf80a04730204b5/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L445C5-L452C6) function:

```solidity
/**
 * @notice  Returns the minimum fee for a given message length
 * @param   length  Length of the message (in bytes)
 * @return  uint256  The minimum fee
 */
function getFee(uint256 length) public view returns (uint256) {
    return length * feePerByte;
}
```

This means that empty data payloads do not impose a fee on callers.

Using empty payloads, it would be perfectly possible to recreate an implementation of [LayerZero's Ping Pong](https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/evm-guides/code-examples/lzapp-overview/pingpong.sol) example by configuring a message loop between cross-chain contract deployments.

However, this would be entirely subsidised by the Avail bridging network.

This would continue **indefinitely** between chains, leading to increased network congestion and increased financial burden for bridge operators at negligible cost to an attacker.

## Impact

I consider this to be a high severity issue.

If an attacker were to deploy a recursive [`sendMessage(bytes32,bytes)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/1afb56b8d4dfbf5d3f21bed0ddf80a04730204b5/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L300) via contract deployments on both sides of the network, it would be possible to create an infinite message loop which will continue until the end of time - far after bridge operators become insolvent.

A competing cross-chain protocol, as an economically incentivised adversary, possesses sufficient motivation to take advantage of this flaw.

This issue can be further exacerbated to the point of DoS, since an attacker need only repeatedly invoke one side of a recursive message loop in an effort to linearly scale the burden on the network at negligible cost.

In addition, there are valid use-cases for an empty payloads, meaning we cannot outright filter out such messages (not to mention this would diminish protocol neutrality and complicate [delivery of a light client](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/1afb56b8d4dfbf5d3f21bed0ddf80a04730204b5/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L317)).

For completeness, it should be emphasised that the [`feePerByte`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/1afb56b8d4dfbf5d3f21bed0ddf80a04730204b5/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L54) model does not seem to account for gas costs when the message is executed, meaning that attackers can further stress gas consumption at expense of the bridge i.e. by executing a [returnbomb](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/156233/what-is-a-returnbomb-attack).

## Code Snippet

```solidity
/**
 * @notice  Returns the minimum fee for a given message length
 * @param   length  Length of the message (in bytes)
 * @return  uint256  The minimum fee
 */
function getFee(uint256 length) public view returns (uint256) {
    return length * feePerByte;
}
```

## Tool used

Vim

## Recommendation

Consider introducing a minimum transaction fee in addition to the [`feePerByte`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/1afb56b8d4dfbf5d3f21bed0ddf80a04730204b5/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L54).

```diff
/**
 * @notice  Returns the minimum fee for a given message length
 * @param   length  Length of the message (in bytes)
 * @return  uint256  The minimum fee
 */
function getFee(uint256 length) public view returns (uint256) {
-    return length * feePerByte;
+    return length * feePerByte + _MINIMUM_MESSAGE_FEE;
}
```

Additionally, consider employing a [callback gas limit](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/subscription#subscriptions) and have this reflected in [`feePerByte`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/1afb56b8d4dfbf5d3f21bed0ddf80a04730204b5/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L54).
