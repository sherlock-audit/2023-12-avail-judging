# Merkle leaf values are 64 bytes before hashing which can lead to merkle tree collisions

## Summary
The protocol hashes 64 bytes when calculating leaf allowing it to collide with the internal nodes of the merkle tree.


## Vulnerability Detail
[MerkleProofUpgradeable.sol](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/utils#MerkleProof) puts the following warning at the beginning of the contract:
```solidity
 * WARNING: You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to
 * hashing, or use a hash function other than keccak256 for hashing leaves.
 * This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in
 * the merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value.
```

The following code has an issue because it uses `input.blobRoot` and `input.bridgeRoot` as the bases for leaves, both of which are bytes32 (totaling 64 bytes). This allows conflicts between leaves and inner nodes.
```solidity
 if (
            !input.dataRootProof.verify(
                dataRootCommitment, input.dataRootIndex, keccak256(abi.encode(input.blobRoot, input.bridgeRoot))
            )
        ) {
            revert InvalidDataRootProof();
        }
```

## Impact
