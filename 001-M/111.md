# Usage of 64 bytes before hashing can lead to merkle tree collisions

## Summary

AvailBridge hashes 64 bytes when calculating the leaf allowing it to collide with the internal nodes of the merkle tree.

## Vulnerability Detail

In AvailBridge.sol, 2 32bytes input is used when hashing the leaf.

```solidity
        if (
            !input.dataRootProof.verify(
 @>             dataRootCommitment, input.dataRootIndex, keccak256(abi.encode(input.blobRoot, input.bridgeRoot))
            )
        ) {
            revert InvalidDataRootProof();
```

If 2 32bytes is used, the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in the Merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value.

## Impact

Users can abuse the merkle tree collisions to withdraw funds from the contract.

## Recommendation

Use a combination of variables that doesn't sum up to 64 bytes.
