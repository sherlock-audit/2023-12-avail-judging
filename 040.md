# ERC20 Permit Implementation

## Summary
The **WrappedAvail** contract incorporates **ERC20Permit**, which provides an efficient mechanism for token approvals using signatures. Ensuring the secure implementation of this feature is crucial to safeguard token operations.
## Vulnerability Detail
The **ERC20Permit** feature introduces complexities around signature handling and nonce management. Flaws in this implementation can lead to vulnerabilities such as signature replay attacks or unauthorized approvals, posing risks to token security.
## Impact
Inadequate handling of permits can lead to various security issues, including:

- **Unauthorized Token Transfers:** Exploitation of permit vulnerabilities can enable attackers to transfer tokens without proper authorization.
- **Signature Replay Attacks:** If nonces or expiration times are not correctly managed, the same permit signature could be used multiple times.
