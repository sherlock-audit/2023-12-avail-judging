## Summary

When receiving a message/token, the contract specifically blocks sending to `address(0)` however by using a purposefully malformed address they can still send it there due to the truncation that occurs.

## Vulnerability Detail

[AvailBridge.sol#L200](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L200)

        address dest = address(bytes20(message.to));

When messages are created they use a generic `bytes32` data type so they are compatible with other blockchains that user 32 byte addresses instead of the 20 byte ones used on EVM chains. To convert between these, the contract simply truncates and converts to address. Truncation allows users to specify an address that is non-zero but that truncates to `address(0)`. By putting values only in the bytes lost to truncation and leaving the rest blank, a user can bypass this restriction.

## Impact

Tokens and messages can be sent to `address(0)`

## Recommendation

Check if `dest == address(0)` after truncation.
