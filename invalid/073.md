# Missing Zero Address Validation for Token Addresses

## Summary
The smart contract does not consistently validate that token addresses are not the zero address, notably in the updateTokens function.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the updateTokens function, there's no check to prevent the zero address from being set as a token address. This could lead to scenarios where tokens are sent to the zero address, effectively getting burned and causing irreversible financial loss.
## Impact
Sending tokens to the zero address would result in a permanent loss of those tokens, which could be significant depending on the amount and the token's value.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check to ensure that none of the **tokenAddresses** are the zero address. This can be done by adding a condition like **require(tokenAddresses[i] != address(0), "Token address cannot be the zero address");** inside the loop.
