# Messages can be replayed across forks.

## Summary

The messages can be replayed in across forks, allowing wallet to receive multiple amount of ERC-20 tokens, AVAIL or native currency across destination forks.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `AvailBridge` contract constants `AVAIL_DOMAIN` and `ETH_DOMAIN` are used to distinguish origin and destination domain for the bridge. The contract's functionality does not take into account if either the Blockchain is forked, allowing messages to be replayed across forks.

## Impact

It would lead to messages being replayed across forked chains allowing wallet to receive multiple amount of ERC-20 tokens, AVAIL or native currency across destination forks.

## Recommendation

Consider using `block.chainid` when composing or consuming message in the origin and destination domain respectively instead of hardcoded constants used.
