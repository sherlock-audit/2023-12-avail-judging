# Some tokens may revert when zero value transfers are made

## Summary
Some tokens may revert when zero value transfers are made
## Vulnerability Detail
In spite of the fact that `EIP-20` states (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/46b9b698815abbfa628cd1097311deee77dd45c5/EIPS/eip-20.md?plain=1#L116) that zero-valued transfers must be accepted but some `ERC-20` token will revert on transection.
## Impact
 Some tokens, such as `LEND` will revert if this is attempted, which may cause transactions that involve other tokens (such as batch operations) to fully revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider skipping the transfer if the amount is zero, which will also save gas.
