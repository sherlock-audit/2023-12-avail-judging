# `AvailBridge` cannot receive ETH, and consequently will not properly send ETH to the recipient

## Summary
`AvailBridge` does not have a way to receive native ETH for transfer in `receiveETH` blocking intended fund transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `AvailBridge.sol`, `receiveETH` is intended to be called by underlying infrastructure in response to a message sent from Avail. It attempts to transfer ETH corresponding to the value specified in the message data to `message.to` using a low level call.

```solidity
        (bool success,) = dest.call{value: value}("");
        if (!success) {
            revert UnlockFailed();
        }
```
The issue is there is no way to send ETH to the bridge since `receiveETH` is not payable and the contract does not have a payable fallback or receive function. Consequently, the ETH transferred must come from fees paid from arbitrary messaging to Avail. If these fees are insufficient, `receiveETH` will revert.

## Impact
Recipient of ETH to be transferred in `receiveETH` does not receive funds, or funds are taken from messaging fees which are intended for the `feeRecipient`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a payable receive function to `AvailBridge.sol` so it can be funded (by whatever account that calls `receiveETH`).
