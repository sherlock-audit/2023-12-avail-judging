# Centralization Risk:

## Summary
Centralization Risk: The contract relies on a single availBridge address, which introduces a central point of control and failure. If the availBridge is compromised, it could lead to security issues.

## Vulnerability Detail
  function onAvailMessage(bytes32 from, bytes calldata data) public virtual {
        if (msg.sender != availBridge) {
            revert OnlyAvailBridge();
        }
        _onAvailMessage(from, data);
    }
## Impact
 If the availBridge is compromised, it could lead to security issues.
