# Excessive fee not returned

## Summary
The [sendMessage()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L300) function in the AvailBridge smart contract exposes a vulnerability where users incur irreversible ether losses when mistakenly sending more than the calculated fee. The current implementation lacks a refund mechanism for excess ethers.

## Vulnerability Detail
The sendMessage() function in the AvailBridge smart contract lacks a mechanism to refund users for excessive ether sent when the amount send for fees exceeds the amount returned by [getFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L450). The current implementation only ensures that the ethers received must be greater or equal to the calculated fee, but does not have any refunding mechanism resulting in the loss of excess funds.

## Impact

Users mistakenly sending more ether than required for the transaction fee incur an irrecoverable loss of the excessive amount.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
        if (msg.value < getFee(length)) {
            revert FeeTooLow();
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a refund mechanism to return any excess ether sent by users. Adjust the relevant code as follows:
```solidity
uint256 fee = getFee(length);
if (msg.value < fee) {
    revert FeeTooLow();
}

// Refund excess ether to the sender
uint256 excessEther = msg.value - fee;
if (excessEther > 0) {
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: excessEther}("");
    if (!success) {
        revert RefundFailed();
    }
}
```
