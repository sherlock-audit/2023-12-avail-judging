# All ether balance of bridge contract can be drained with a malicious proposal or  improper  input validation  on `AvailBridge::updateTokens`

## Summary
Many big protocols like Tornado or recent Socket bridge got hacked due to the improper only owner or governer's wrong input validation. While socket aproved wrong upgrade implementation, tornado governance tookover with malicious proposal to selfdestruct. Loot DAO's malicious proposal was stopped by active scanning by phalcon Blocksec team.
We should implement validations even on only owner functions.

Potential governance takeover oppurtunity can drain ETH in the bridge contract. This attack can be possible due to improper input validation and can have impact if the governor is a DAO and malicious proposals can be made. Or a owner wallet that doesn't properly setups the input parameters.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [AvailBridge::updateTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L132-L146) function does not validate if the assetid in the array should not be equal to the assetId of ETH. The governance updates the [AvailBridge::updateTokens](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L132-L146) to add the supporting bridging for assetId and respective token addresses.


## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function updateTokens(bytes32[] calldata assetIds, address[] calldata tokenAddresses)
        external
        onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
    {
        uint256 length = assetIds.length;
        if (length != tokenAddresses.length) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length;) {
@===>       tokens[assetIds[i]] = tokenAddresses[i];
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```
## POC
- It is possible to pass a proposal to add a bunch of supporting assets. Or even a governor decides to add some tokens.
- If any of the [assetIds in the array matches](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/1afb56b8d4dfbf5d3f21bed0ddf80a04730204b5/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L132-L146) the assetId of native [ETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/1afb56b8d4dfbf5d3f21bed0ddf80a04730204b5/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L41), then that assetId is allocated to some token which has a lower price than ETH (99% of the tokens have lower price than ETH).
- So now  ETH's assetId being mapped to some token, we can buy them for low price and call [AvailBridge::sendERC20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/1afb56b8d4dfbf5d3f21bed0ddf80a04730204b5/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L383) to bridge them to Avail network.
- After some time the recipient will get native ETH on avail Network. And now he can bridge it back again and claim by calling [AvailBridge::receiveETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/1afb56b8d4dfbf5d3f21bed0ddf80a04730204b5/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L239) to get ETH back.

So, overall attack flow consists of => pass malicious proposal => bridge ERC20 that linked to ETH on mainnet ==> claim ETH on Avail => Use on Avail Network or bridge back to calim pure ETH on mainnet.
So profit off of the price difference between the toekn and ETH.

## Impact
Drain all ether balance of teh bridge contract.
