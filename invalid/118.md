# Denial of Service when vectorx address is changed

## Summary

Avail Bridge can cause DOS by not processing proofs from any previous vectorx contract attached to it.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since avail bridge can only process proofs which are committed on vectorx, but vectorx can be changed and throughout its lifetime it can hold multiple values. However, it can only allow proofs to be process from any one of them causing proofs containing token / data to be remain locked.

## Impact

Once `vectorx` is changed using `updateVectorx` then `receiveMessage`, `receiveAVAIL` and `receiveETH` will not allow to use proofs to verify their inputs and do the necessary unlocks on any of message in previous root commitments which are not unlocked resulting in DOS by not being able to unlock tokens / data on ethereum and also it being simultaneously marked as sent from avail since commitment is posted.

If `updateVectorx` is called again to rollback to old vectorx address, then proofs from new vectorx can't be processed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make vectorx immutable and if there is need to change vectorx, a new bridge contract should be deployed with new vectorx. Alternatively, avail bridge should have logic to handle more than one vectorx if it can be changed.
