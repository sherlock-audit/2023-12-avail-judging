# Failing `receive` functions are not handled, leading to loss of funds of a user.

## Summary
When one of the three `receive` function fails, there is no way to retry a message, leading to lost funds of a user.

## Vulnerability Detail
As per the [Notion](https://avail-project.notion.site/The-Avail-Bridge-Public-Copy-a00c2aa4937d496ea346d02a6bb119ff):
```javascript
The bridge is primarily designed as a means to bridge AVAIL tokens to-and-fro Ethereum, this can be expanded into other tokens, with other runtime upgrades, however, to allow for a generalized interface that can be expanded into different use-cases, an arbitrary message bridge on Ethereum is ideal.
```

When a user bridges a token from `AVAIL` to `ETH`, on arrival, one of these functions get called depending on the type of token:
```javascript
function receiveETH()
function receiveERC20()
function receiveAVAIL()
```

The problem however lays in the fact that, if anywhere inside of these three functions they fail, there will be no way for `AVAIL` to know that this call failed, which means the user will not be able to access his funds.

#### Proof of Concept
- Alice bridges `10 ETH` from `AVAIL CHAIN` to `ETH CHAIN` using [send_message](https://github.com/availproject/avail/blob/e976c560ee3f8c7d36d9fbec8e98c29283f1aa34/pallets/succinct/src/lib.rs#L447-L496)
- This `10 ETH` gets sent to a contract on `AVAIL`, locking these ETH funds.
- The message goes in flight and arrives on the `ETH CHAIN`.
- On arrival, `receiveETH` gets called.
- The call fails. The transfer could have failed for whatever reason during the low level call or one of the assertions didn't hold up.
- Due to the fact that there is no callback mechanism, Alice will have lost `10 ETH`. She is not able to access these funds.

The same scenario applies to the `receiveERC20` function and the `receiveAVAIL` function. 

## Impact
If one of these three receive function fail, the user will have lost his funds since they will be either burned on the `srcChain`, like the AVAIL token, or they will be locked on the `srcChain`, like the ETH and ERC20 tokens.

## Code Snippet
```javascript
    function receiveAVAIL(Message calldata message, MerkleProofInput calldata input)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        onlySupportedDomain(message.originDomain, message.destinationDomain)
        onlyTokenTransfer(message.messageType)
    {
        (bytes32 assetId, uint256 value) = abi.decode(message.data, (bytes32, uint256));
        if (assetId != 0x0) {
            revert InvalidAssetId();
        }

        _checkBridgeLeaf(message, input);

        // downcast SCALE-encoded bytes to an Ethereum address
        address dest = address(bytes20(message.to));

        emit MessageReceived(message.from, dest, message.messageId);

        avail.mint(dest, value);
    }

    {
        (bytes32 assetId, uint256 value) = abi.decode(message.data, (bytes32, uint256));
        if (assetId != ETH_ASSET_ID) {
            revert InvalidAssetId();
        }

        _checkBridgeLeaf(message, input);

        // downcast SCALE-encoded bytes to an Ethereum address
        address dest = address(bytes20(message.to));

        emit MessageReceived(message.from, dest, message.messageId);

        // slither-disable-next-line arbitrary-send-eth,missing-zero-check,low-level-calls
        (bool success,) = dest.call{value: value}("");
        if (!success) {
            revert UnlockFailed();
        }
    }

    /**

     */
    function receiveERC20(Message calldata message, MerkleProofInput calldata input)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        onlySupportedDomain(message.originDomain, message.destinationDomain)
        onlyTokenTransfer(message.messageType)
        nonReentrant
    {
        (bytes32 assetId, uint256 value) = abi.decode(message.data, (bytes32, uint256));
        address token = tokens[assetId];
        if (token == address(0)) {
            revert InvalidAssetId();
        }

        _checkBridgeLeaf(message, input);

        // downcast SCALE-encoded bytes to an Ethereum address
        address dest = address(bytes20(message.to));

        emit MessageReceived(message.from, dest, message.messageId);

        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(dest, value);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a callback mechanism which notifies the `srcChain` if the bridging has failed. This mechanism could be used to retry messages.
