# No way to recover funds from the failed bridge transaction.

## Summary
No way to recover funds from the failed bridge transaction.
## Vulnerability Detail
If the bridge transaction fails and the recipient is unable to receive the tokens/ETH all funds will be lost.

For example, someone initiates a bridge transaction to bridge USDC from Avail to Ethereum.

On the Ethereum side, the `receiveER20` function is used to process and prove that the bridge transaction is correct and should be processed.

```solidity
function receiveERC20(Message calldata message, MerkleProofInput calldata input)
    external
    whenNotPaused
    onlySupportedDomain(message.originDomain, message.destinationDomain)
    onlyTokenTransfer(message.messageType)
    nonReentrant
{
    (bytes32 assetId, uint256 value) = abi.decode(message.data, (bytes32, uint256));
    address token = tokens[assetId];
    if (token == address(0)) {
        revert InvalidAssetId();
    }

    _checkBridgeLeaf(message, input);

    // downcast SCALE-encoded bytes to an Ethereum address
    address dest = address(bytes20(message.to));

    emit MessageReceived(message.from, dest, message.messageId);

    IERC20(token).safeTransfer(dest, value);
}
```

If the `IERC20(token).safeTransfer(dest, value)` fails the transaction will revert and the funds will be lost. It can fail if the receiving address is on a blacklist. Or when transferring ETH it can fail if the smart contract doesn't support receiving ether.
## Impact
All funds can be lost while bridging.

## Recommendation
In case of a failure add a mechanism where the bridge tx initiator can claim their tokens back.
