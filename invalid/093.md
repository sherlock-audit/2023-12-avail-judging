# Incorrect Data Length Validation in ```AvailBridge::sendMessage``` function

## Summary
The ```AvailBridge::sendMessage``` function contains an ```if``` statement that checks whether the length of the data being sent is greater than or equal to the ```MAX_DATA_LENGTH``` constant. The current implementation uses a ```>=``` comparison, which is inconsistent with the project requirements that specify the data must not exceed 100KB (102,400 bytes) that is the Ethereum calldata limits (ref. https://avail-project.notion.site/The-Avail-Bridge-Public-Copy-a00c2aa4937d496ea346d02a6bb119ff - paragraph: Bridging extrinsics specification). This discrepancy can lead to unexpected reverts for messages that are exactly 100KB in size.

## Vulnerability Detail
This mismatch leads to these vulnerabilities:
- Expectation Mismatch: Users may expect to be able to send messages of exactly 100KB, but the current condition will revert such transactions.
- Wasted Gas: Transactions that are reverted due to this condition result in unnecessary gas expenditure for the users.
- User Experience: The inconsistency between the contract's behaviour and the project requirements can lead to confusion and a negative user experience.

## Impact
The impact of this issue is primarily on user experience and user loss of funds in reverted transactions. While it does not pose a direct security threat to the funds or the integrity of the smart contract, it can lead to frustration and decreased trust if users' legitimate transactions are unexpectedly reverted.

## Code Snippet
Link to the code snippet: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L300C5-L321C6
```solidity
uint256 private constant MAX_DATA_LENGTH = 102_400;

function sendMessage(bytes32 recipient, bytes calldata data) external payable whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = data.length;
@>        if (length >= MAX_DATA_LENGTH) {
             revert ExceedsMaxDataLength();
        }
        // ensure that fee is above minimum amount
        if (msg.value < getFee(length)) {
            revert FeeTooLow();
        }
        uint256 id;
        unchecked {
            id = messageId++;
        }
        fees += msg.value;
        Message memory message = Message(
            MESSAGE_TX_PREFIX, bytes32(bytes20(msg.sender)), recipient, ETH_DOMAIN, AVAIL_DOMAIN, data, uint64(id)
        );
        // store message hash to be retrieved later by our light client
        isSent[id] = keccak256(abi.encode(message));

        emit MessageSent(msg.sender, recipient, id);
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The condition in the ```sendMessage``` function should be updated to reflect the intended behaviour as specified in the project requirements. The corrected condition should use a ```>``` comparison instead of ```>=```:

```diff
function sendMessage(bytes32 recipient, bytes calldata data) external payable whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = data.length;
-        if (length >= MAX_DATA_LENGTH) {
+.      if (length > MAX_DATA_LENGTH) {
            revert ExceedsMaxDataLength();
        }
        // ensure that fee is above minimum amount
        if (msg.value < getFee(length)) {
            revert FeeTooLow();
        }
        uint256 id;
        unchecked {
            id = messageId++;
        }
        fees += msg.value;
        Message memory message = Message(
            MESSAGE_TX_PREFIX, bytes32(bytes20(msg.sender)), recipient, ETH_DOMAIN, AVAIL_DOMAIN, data, uint64(id)
        );
        // store message hash to be retrieved later by our light client
        isSent[id] = keccak256(abi.encode(message));

        emit MessageSent(msg.sender, recipient, id);
    }

```
