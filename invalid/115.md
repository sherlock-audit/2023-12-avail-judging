# WithdrawFees can be called by anyone which can lead to loss of funds.

## Summary
In `AvailBridge.sol` the function `WithdrawFees` allows anyone to place a withdrawal towards the `FeeRecipient`. This in itself is not a problem at first glance, but could become a means to loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
If a malicious user gains access to the fee recipient, they have the ability to consistently withdraw fees to the recipient destination. This risk persists as long as the team has not changed the fee recipient, potentially resulting in an additional loss of funds or in another example causing hindrance to the team funds

## Impact
Critical Example :
 - Bob compromises the Feerecipient address
 - Team will obviously update to new Feerecipient
 - but in meantime team will lose funds 
 - because Bob can call `withdrawFees` to old recipient 
 - Team has no pause mechanism for withdrawing aswell
 - Team loses out on additional funds 

 Medium Example  :
 - Team decides to change Feerecipient 
 - Bob watches this function and sees this movement
 - Bob calls Withdrawfees with high gas prio on the Old Recipient
 - This will go through before the Feerecipient change happens
 - Team gets fees sent to old recipient address
 - if team does not have access to this address anymore, they lose fees

Regardless of the specific example chosen, the outcome remains consistent â€“ it poses a hindrance at the very least and, in the worst-case scenario, leads to a potential loss of funds.
