# Lack of Zero Address Validation in Constructor

## Summary
The constructor of the **WrappedAvail** contract does not validate the input for the bridge address. Accepting a zero address could lead to a non-functional contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract is initialized without checking if the provided _bridge address is the zero address. This lack of validation might lead to issues in minting and burning functionalities, as these operations rely on the bridge address being a legitimate contract address.
## Impact
If the bridge address is set to zero, it would permanently disable the mint and burn functionalities, as the **onlyAvailBridge** modifier would always fail, potentially rendering the contract useless.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a validation check in the constructor to ensure that the _bridge address is not the zero address. This can be achieved by adding a requirement statement:
```solidity
require(_bridge != address(0), "Bridge address cannot be the zero address");
```
