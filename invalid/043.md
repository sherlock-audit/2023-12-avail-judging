# Excess ETH sent in AvailBridge::sendMessage function not refunded back to the users

## Summary
The `sendMessage` function in the  `AvailBridge` contract lacks proper validation, allowing users to send excess Ether without receiving a refund. This oversight could lead to potential loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises from the condition` if (msg.value < getFee(length))`, which checks if the sent Ether is less than the calculated fee based on the length of the data field. However, it fails to restrict users from sending excess Ether, potentially resulting in unrecoverable losses.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it exposes users to the risk of losing funds. Without proper validation, users can send more Ether than the required fee, and this excess Ether may not be refunded.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function sendMessage(bytes32 recipient, bytes calldata data) external payable whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = data.length;
        if (length >= MAX_DATA_LENGTH) {
            revert ExceedsMaxDataLength();
        }
        // ensure that fee is above minimum amount
        if (msg.value < getFee(length)) {
            revert FeeTooLow();
        }
        uint256 id;
        unchecked {
            id = messageId++;
        }
        fees += msg.value;
        Message memory message = Message(
            MESSAGE_TX_PREFIX, bytes32(bytes20(msg.sender)), recipient, ETH_DOMAIN, AVAIL_DOMAIN, data, uint64(id)
        );
        // store message hash to be retrieved later by our light client
        isSent[id] = keccak256(abi.encode(message));

        emit MessageSent(msg.sender, recipient, id);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement proper validation to restrict users from sending excess Ether. Modify the condition to ensure that only the exact required fee is accepted, preventing potential loss of funds. You can modify it like this:

```solidity
 // Calculate the required fee
    uint256 requiredFee = getFee(length);
// Ensure that the sent Ether is exactly equal to the required fee
    require(msg.value == requiredFee, "Incorrect fee amount");
```
