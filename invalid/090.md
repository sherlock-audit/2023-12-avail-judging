# Integer Overflow in `sendAVAIL` Function

## Summary
The `sendAVAIL` function in the smart contract contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability when typecasting a `uint256` value to a `uint64`. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to exploit the contract when the `id` becomes too large, resulting in unintended behavior or manipulation of the contract state.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `id` variable is initially declared as `uint256`, which means it can potentially exceed the maximum value that a `uint64` can hold. When an overflow occurs during this typecasting, it can lead to unexpected behavior and security risks.

## Impact
If an attacker successfully triggers the integer overflow in the `sendAVAIL` function, it can have several adverse consequences:

1. Data Corruption: An overflowed `id` may lead to data corruption within the contract or unintended data storage in the `isSent` mapping.

2. Manipulation: An attacker could potentially manipulate the contract's state or disrupt its normal operation.

3. Financial Loss: Depending on how the contract uses `id`, an overflow could result in financial losses for users or unintended transfers of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address the integer overflow vulnerability in the `sendAVAIL` function, consider the following recommendations:

1. Validate Inputs: Implement input validation to ensure that the `id` does not exceed the maximum value that can be represented by a `uint64`. This can be done by checking if the `id` is within the valid range before performing the typecast.

2. Safe Casting: Use a safe typecasting method, such as the `SafeMath` library, to ensure that typecasting from `uint256` to `uint64` does not result in an integer overflow.

3. Comprehensive Testing: Thoroughly test the contract with various scenarios to verify that the vulnerability has been effectively mitigated.

By implementing these recommendations, you can enhance the security and reliability of the smart contract, reducing the risk of potential exploits related to integer overflows.
