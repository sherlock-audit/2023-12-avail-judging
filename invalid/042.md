# Lack of Interface Validation in AvailBridge Contract

## Summary
The smart contract code lacks interface validation in the initialize function, specifically during the assignment of the `avail` variable. This oversight may result in the assignment of an address of a contract that doesn't have the required functionality(the function signatures declared in the `IWrappedAvail` interface) as the `avail`, potentially compromising the execution and behavior of the entire contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the provided code, the initialize function assigns an address to the avail variable without verifying whether it adheres to the specified interface` (IWrappedAvail)`. The problem is that when deploying the `AvailBridge` contract, the `deployer` can provide a contract address for the `avail` that doesn't have the implemented functionality that is required in the interface `IWrappedAvail`. If this happens, the code will result in a compilation error.


## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it opens the possibility of interacting with a `IWrappedAvail` that does not conform to the expected interface. This can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function initialize(
        uint256 newFeePerByte,
        address newFeeRecipient,
        IWrappedAvail newAvail,
        address governance,
        address pauser,
        IVectorx newVectorx
    ) external initializer {
        feePerByte = newFeePerByte;
        // slither-disable-next-line missing-zero-check
        feeRecipient = newFeeRecipient;
        vectorx = newVectorx;
        avail = newAvail;
        __AccessControlDefaultAdminRules_init(0, governance);
        _grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, pauser);
        __Pausable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Interface Validation: Implement a check in the initialize function to ensure that the assigned `avail` contract adheres to the specified  `IWrappedAvail` interface. This can be achieved by calling the `supportsInterface` function or using a similar method to verify compatibility.

Here is how you can implement interface validation in the `initialize` function:
```solidity
  function initialize(
        uint256 newFeePerByte,
        address newFeeRecipient,
        IWrappedAvail newAvail,
        address governance,
        address pauser,
        IVectorx newVectorx
    ) external initializer {
        feePerByte = newFeePerByte;
        // slither-disable-next-line missing-zero-check
        feeRecipient = newFeeRecipient;
        vectorx = newVectorx;

        require(
       supportsInterface(newAvail, type(IWrappedAvail).interfaceId),
            "Avail manager does not support IWrappedAvail interface"
       );

        avail = newAvail;
        __AccessControlDefaultAdminRules_init(0, governance);
        _grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, pauser);
        __Pausable_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    }

   // Check if a contract supports a specific interface
   function supportsInterface(address _contract, bytes4 _interfaceId) internal view returns (bool) {
      (bool success, bytes memory result) = _contract.staticcall(abi.encodeWithSelector(0x40c10f19, _interfaceId));
       return success && (result.length > 0);
  }
```
