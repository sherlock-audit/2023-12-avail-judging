# No upper bound for setting feePerByte, can lead to excessive fees

## Summary
The improper definition of an upper bound on fees in this system could
potentially result in excessive fees and harm the user experience. This is
because the upper bound is not adequately constrained, and it is possible
for fees to be set at levels that are much higher than expected or
reasonable. This can create a financial burden for users and discourage
the use of the system.
It is important for the system to properly
define the upper bound on fees to ensure that fees are not set at excessive
levels and to protect the user experience and the security of the system.
## Vulnerability Detail
Fees are paid per byte of the message `data` length being sent 
```solidity
function sendMessage(bytes32 recipient, bytes calldata data) external payable whenNotPaused {
        uint256 length = data.length;
        if (length >= MAX_DATA_LENGTH) {
            revert ExceedsMaxDataLength();
        }
        // ensure that fee is above minimum amount
        if (msg.value < getFee(length)) {
            revert FeeTooLow();
        }
        uint256 id;
        unchecked {
            id = messageId++;
        }
        fees += msg.value;
        Message memory message = Message(
            MESSAGE_TX_PREFIX, bytes32(bytes20(msg.sender)), recipient, ETH_DOMAIN, AVAIL_DOMAIN, data, uint64(id)
        );
        // store message hash to be retrieved later by our light client
        isSent[id] = keccak256(abi.encode(message));

        emit MessageSent(msg.sender, recipient, id);
    }
```
The fee is calculated in `getFee` where the `feePerByte` is multiplied by the length of the `data`
```solidity
function getFee(uint256 length) public view returns (uint256) {
        return length * feePerByte;
    }
```
If `feePerBytes` can be set without constraints the fee may be set too high or too low, if set too high users would not be able to pay the fees for sending messages 

## Impact
Users will not be able to pay the fees if` feePerByte ` is set too high

```solidity
    function updateFeePerByte(uint256 newFeePerByte) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        feePerByte = newFeePerByte;
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended that the system properly define the upper bound on fees
to ensure that fees are not set at excessive levels and to protect the
user experience. This can be done by setting a specific maximum limit
on fees.
