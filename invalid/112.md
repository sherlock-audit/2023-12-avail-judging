# Loss of funds when sending a message

## Summary
Loss of funds when sending a message.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the "sendMessage" function, the user has to pay a certain amount of Ether in order to send a message. Since the price is not fixed, but is calculated based on the length of the message and there is no view function to find out the price of the message, the user has to send more ether, so he does not know the actual price of the message, and an insufficient msg.value will cause the function to revert.
## Impact
A user can send more ether than he should.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommended to add a view function for calculating the price of a message. User will know the real price and will not overpay.
```solidity
function getPriceForMessage(bytes calldata data) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 length = data.length;
        if (length >= MAX_DATA_LENGTH) {
            revert ExceedsMaxDataLength();
        }
        return getFee(length);
    }
```
