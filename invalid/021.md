# Use of Inline Assembly (SWC-112)

## Summary
The contract utilizes inline assembly for its operations, which can be error-prone and hard to audit, potentially leading to security risks.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inline assembly is used in the verify function of the Merkle contract to optimize the Merkle proof verification process. While inline assembly allows for more fine-grained control and potential gas optimizations, it also bypasses several safety checks and high-level abstractions provided by Solidity. This can lead to vulnerabilities related to stack issues, incorrect memory management, or unforeseen interactions with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## Impact
Improper use of inline assembly can lead to critical vulnerabilities, including incorrect computation of Merkle proofs, leading to invalid verification results. It also makes the code less maintainable and harder to audit, increasing the risk of overlooking potential security flaws.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Minimize the use of inline assembly and ensure that any assembly code is isolated, well-documented, and thoroughly reviewed and tested. Consider using high-level Solidity constructs where possible and reserve assembly for critical optimizations only.
