# No cap on feePerByte

## Summary
There is no upper limit on ```feePerByte```

## Vulnerability Detail
In the **AvailBridge** smart contract, the [updateFeePerByte](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L153) function allows for the update of the ```feePerByte``` variable without enforcing an upper limit. This absence of a maximum cap on the fee per byte could pose a security risk, potentially leading to a situation where the fee becomes excessively high, making transactions prohibitively expensive for users.
## Impact

Exploiting the absence of an upper limit on the feePerByte variable could lead to exorbitant transaction costs, discouraging user participation and potentially causing economic inefficiencies.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function updateFeePerByte(
        uint256 newFeePerByte
    ) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        feePerByte = newFeePerByte;
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a variable like MAX_FEE_PER_BYTE that sets a limit to prevent excessive fees.
```solidity
// Define a reasonable upper limit for the fee per byte
uint256 private constant MAX_FEE_PER_BYTE = 1000 wei;

function updateFeePerByte(uint256 newFeePerByte) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    require(newFeePerByte <= MAX_FEE_PER_BYTE, "Exceeds maximum fee per byte");
    feePerByte = newFeePerByte;
}
```
