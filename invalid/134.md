# Lack of zero checks in updateTokens allows AvailBridge assetId to be set

## Summary

`AvailBridge` uses assetIds to map bytes32 values to ERC20 tokens. These are provided as arguments by users when referring to ERC20 assets. In a message the native token Avail has the zero ID but setting its asset ID to its contract would allow it to be used with the generic `sendERC20` method.

## Vulnerability Detail

A separate method is provided to bridge Avail but if its address is added to the `tokens` mapping, it will be possible to use the generic method for ERC20s which won't mint and burn Avail as intended. The admin is able to do so due to the lack of zero checks.

## Impact

This could allow users to use the contract in a way that wasn't intended and tokens will not be minted and burned as the bridge is used.

```solidity
function updateTokens(bytes32[] calldata assetIds, address[] calldata tokenAddresses)
        external
        onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
    {
        uint256 length = assetIds.length;
        if (length != tokenAddresses.length) {
            revert ArrayLengthMismatch();
        }
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length;) {
            tokens[assetIds[i]] = tokenAddresses[i];
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Recommendation

Add zero checks to `updateTokens`.
