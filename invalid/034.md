# Restrictive Condition Check for Maximum Data Length in AvailBridge::sendMessage

## Summary

The contract contains a condition that checks for the length of a variable against the maximum data length (`MAX_DATA_LENGTH`). However, the current condition, `if (length >= MAX_DATA_LENGTH)`, would result in the code reverting as soon as the length reaches or exceeds the maximum value, preventing it from reaching the intended maximum data length.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability in the code lies in the overly restrictive condition check for the length of a variable against the maximum data length `(MAX_DATA_LENGTH)`. The current condition,` if (length >= MAX_DATA_LENGTH)`, is designed to revert as soon as the length reaches or exceeds the specified maximum value. This immediate reversion prevents the code from reaching the intended maximum data length, leading to premature termination of the code execution.

The issue arises from the use of the greater than or equal to `(>=)` comparison operator. This operator causes the code to revert even when the length becomes equal to the maximum allowed, restricting the variable from reaching the specified maximum data length.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is that the code will never reach the intended maximum data length (`MAX_DATA_LENGTH`). Instead, it will revert as soon as the length reaches the maximum value, potentially disrupting the intended functionality.

## Code Snippet
reference: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol#L302-L304
```solidity
if (length >= MAX_DATA_LENGTH) {
    revert ExceedsMaxDataLength();
}
```
## Tool used
Manual review
## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, I recommend that you modify the condition in the code snippet to `if (length > MAX_DATA_LENGTH)`. This modification ensures that the code only reverts when the length exceeds the specified maximum data length, allowing the variable to reach the intended maximum length before triggering a revert.
