# Fee Management and Withdrawal

## Summary
The contract charges fees for bridging operations and accumulates them. Proper management of these fees is crucial to prevent unauthorized access or loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
The **withdrawFees** function allows withdrawing accumulated fees to the **feeRecipient**. The security of these funds relies on the integrity of the **feeRecipient** address and the correct calculation and handling of fees.

## Impact
If the **feeRecipient** is not securely managed, or if there's a bug in the fee handling logic, there could be unauthorized withdrawal or loss of fees.
## Code Snippet

The withdrawFees function sends the accumulated fees to the feeRecipient.

2. Audit Fee Handling Logic: Thoroughly audit the logic for fee calculation, accumulation, and withdrawal.
3. Regularly Monitor Fee Transactions: Implement monitoring for the fee transactions to ensure that withdrawals are as expected and no unauthorized access occurs.
