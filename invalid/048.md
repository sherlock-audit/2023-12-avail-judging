# Missing Zero-Address Check in Constructor

## Summary
The constructor of the `WrappedAvail` smart contract currently lacks a crucial zero-address check for the bridge parameter. This omission introduces a potential vulnerability that could impede the intended functionalities of minting and burning ERC20 tokens (WAVAIL).


## Vulnerability Detail
The absence of a zero-address check in the constructor allows for the deployment of the contract with an invalid or zero address as the bridge. This oversight poses a risk of undesired consequences, potentially disrupting the minting and burning operations and compromising the integrity of the ERC20 token contract.


## Impact
If the `bridge` parameter is set to a zero address during contract deployment, it may result in unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. The contract won't be able to mint or burn the tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a require statement to verify that the supplied address is not the zero address

```diff
constructor(address _bridge) ERC20Permit("Wrapped Avail") ERC20("WAVAIL", "Wrapped Avail") {
+    require(_bridge != address(0), "Bridge address cannot be zero");
    bridge = _bridge;
}
```
