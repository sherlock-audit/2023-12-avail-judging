# Message Source Authentication

## Summary
Ensuring that incoming messages are only accepted from the legitimate Avail AMB is critical to prevent unauthorized actions or injection of malicious data.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract checks that the message sender is the authorized Avail AMB using **msg.sender != availBridge**. This check is pivotal, and the integrity of the **availBridge** address is crucial. If compromised or incorrectly set, unauthorized entities could send messages, leading to potential contract manipulation.
## Impact
If the availBridge address is not securely managed, or if there's a vulnerability in how the contract determines the message sender, it might lead to unauthorized message processing.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-avail/blob/main/contracts/src/MessageReceiver.sol#L18-L23

This function ensures that the message is only processed if it's coming from the authorized Avail AMB.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Secure Initialization and Management of **availBridge**: Ensure that **availBridge** is set correctly upon contract deployment and provide secure mechanisms (if necessary) to update it, guarding against unauthorized changes.
