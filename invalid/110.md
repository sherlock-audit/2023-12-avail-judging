# THE `msg.sender` OF THE `AvailBridge.sendMessage` TRANSACTION WILL LOSE THE EXCESSIVE NATIVE ETH FUNDS TRANSFERRED TO THE TRANSACTION SINCE THIER IS NOT LOGIC TO REFUND THE EXCESSIVE AMOUNT

## Summary

The `AvailBridge.sendMessage` function does not refund the excessive native `eth` (to the msg.sender) transferred to the contract after accounting for the respective fee amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `AvailBridge.sendMessage` function is used for passing arbitrary data from Ethereum to Avail. The `sendMessage` is payable function and expected to recieve native eth which greater than the fee amount calculated based on the given message length which is to be passed to `Avail chain`.

There is an input validation check to ensure the `msg.value >= fee amount` as shown below:

```solidity
        if (msg.value < getFee(length)) { //@audit-info - check msg.value against the minimum fee for a given message length
            revert FeeTooLow();
        }
```

But the issue here is that, if more native `eth` is transferred as fee to this `sendMessage` transaction that excessive eth will also be added to the `fee` state variable without being refunded to the `msg.sender`

## Impact

This is loss of funds to the `msg.sender` if he mistakenly sends in a very large native eth amount (way more than the required fee amount) while calling the `sendMessage` transaction.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
        if (msg.value < getFee(length)) {
            revert FeeTooLow();
        }
```

```solidity
        fees += msg.value;
```

## Tool used
VSCode and Manual Review

## Recommendation

Hence it is recommended to add a logic to the `AvailBridge.sendMessage` function to refund the excessive native eth transferred to the `sendMessage` transaction, to the `msg.sender` after accounting for the `calculated fee amount based on the message length` to be passed to the `Avail` chain.
