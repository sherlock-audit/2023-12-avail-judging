# Input Validation Issues and Centralized Administration Put AvailBridge Interoperability Contract At Risk

## Summary

- The contract does not properly validate all external inputs like Merkle proofs, fees, and addresses. This could allow messages/transactions to be replayed or invalid ones to be accepted.

- Single point of privilege for critical upgrades by governance can compromise core systems if governance is compromised.

- Arbitrary calls through fallback function could enable exploitation of other contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Lack of Merkle proof validation in receiveMessage, receiveAVAIL, receiveETH, receiveERC20 functions (/2023-12-avail/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol). An invalid proof could allow replay or acceptance of bogus messages.
2. Tokens mapping allows any address to be set without check that it is an ERC20 contract. This could enable token draining. (/2023-12-avail/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol)
3. Fee validation in sendMessage relies directly on msg.value without check. Fees could be bypassed. (/2023-12-avail/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol)
4. Fallback function allows arbitrary ether sends, enabling exploitation of other contracts if vulnerabilities. (/2023-12-avail/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol)
5. Single governance role can compromise critical upgrades like VectorX, tokens mapping. (/2023-12-avail/contracts/src/AvailBridge.sol)

## Impact

- Financial losses from replayed/invalid transactions
- Funds loss via token mapping or other contract exploits
- Compromise of core systems like upgrades via governance privilges

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Add input validation for proofs, fees, addresses
- Separate privileges for critical systems upgrades
- Reduce attack surface by removing arbitrary sends
- Consider upgrade path to current standards like EIP-1967 guardian roles
