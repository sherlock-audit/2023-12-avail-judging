# `AvaildBridge.initialize` FUNCTION DOES NOT CHECK THE RETURN BOOLEAN VALUE OF `_grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, pauser)` CALL FOR SUCCESS THUS PUTTING THE ENTIRE BRIDGE IN DANGER IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY

## Summary

`AvaildBridge.initialize` function does not check the return boolean value for success while calling the `_grantRole` internal function to set the `PAUSER_ROLE` to the `pauser` address.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `AvaildBridge.initialize` function is used to `initialize` the state of the `AvaildBridge` contract. This function calls the `AccessControlDefaultAdminRulesUpgradeable._grantRole` inherited internal function to grant the `PAUSER_ROLE` to the `pauser` address as shown below:

        _grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, pauser);

The `_grantRole` function returns a `bool` value indicating the success of the operation as shown below in its function description:

    function _grantRole(bytes32 role, address account) internal virtual override returns (bool) {
    
The issue is the `AvaildBridge.initialize` function does not check this return `bool` value. 

## Impact

As a result even though the `_grantRole` transaction fails the `initialzie` function will not detect the failure and would execute the `initialize` transaction as succesful. So the `governance` will expect the `PAUSER_ROLE` to have been set correctly where as it has not. 

As a result the `AvailBridge` will not able to be paused at an emergency since the `pauser` address provided during the initialization has not been set the `PAUSER_ROLE` thus putting the entire bridge in danger. Furthermore since the `PAUSER_ROLE` is only set in the `AvailBridge.initialize` function and it can be only called once, if not correctly set at the first time there is no logic in the `AvaliBridge` contract to reconfigure the `PAUSER_ROLE` to the `pauser` address or any other address.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
        _grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, pauser);
```

## Tool used
VSCode and Manual Review

## Recommendation

Hence it is recommended to check the return bool value of the `_grantRole(PAUSER_ROLE, pauser)` function call inside the `AvaildBridge.initialize` function and revert the transaction if the `bool value is false`. And the initialization should only proceed as a succesful transaction if the `bool value is true`.
