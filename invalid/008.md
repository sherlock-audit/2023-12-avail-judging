# ERC20 imported contract is not tsing Upgradeable Smart Contract Libraries

## Summary
`AvailBridge.sol` is a smart contract that uses OpenZeppelin's Upgradeable Smart Contract LIbraries. It uses the `WrappedAvail.sol` ERC20 tokens but the ERC20 contract is not upgradable. If the `AvailBridge.sol` is upgradable it's fair to say that even if there isn't any current plans to release a different version, doesn't mean that Avail team never will.

## Vulnerability Detail
When working with an upgradeable smart contract pattern, it is important to ensure that all contracts involved, including the ERC20 token contract, are designed to be compatible with the upgradeability mechanism.  [Openzeppelin Docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#use-upgradeable-libraries) state "Keep in mind that this restriction affects not only your contracts, but also the contracts you import from a library."
## Impact
While `WrappedAvail.sol` itself doesn't need to be upgradeable, if there are plans to upgrade ERC20Contract in the future, `AvailBridge.sol` should be designed to handle changes in  `WrappedAvail.sol` interface or behavior without breaking.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the ERC20 contract is upgradable to be in par with `AvailBridge.sol`.
For example:
```solidity
// @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Upgradeable.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

...

contract ERC20Upgradeable is Initializable, ContextUpgradeable, IERC20Upgradeable {
    ...

    string private _name;
    string private _symbol;

    function __ERC20_init(string memory name_, string memory symbol_) internal onlyInitializing {
        __ERC20_init_unchained(name_, symbol_);
    }

    function __ERC20_init_unchained(string memory name_, string memory symbol_) internal onlyInitializing {
        _name = name_;
        _symbol = symbol_;
    }

    ...
}
```
