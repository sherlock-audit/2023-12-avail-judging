# __gap  VARIABLE IS NOT DEFINED IN THE `AvailBridge` UPGRADEABLE CONTRACT

## Summary

`AvailBridge` contract is expected to operate as an upgradeable contract. But the __gap variable is not defined in its storage layout which could prompt storage collisions in the future if new storage variables are added to the `AvailBridge` base contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `AvailBridge` contract is an `upgradeable contract` and is expected to be used as a logic contract with a proxy, but the `AvailBridge` contract does not have a __gap variable defined as a state variable in its storage layout.

## Impact

This would become problematic if a subsequent version of the `AvailBridge` was to inherit this contract as a base contract. If the child contracts derived from the `AvaildBridge` also had storage variables and the subsequent version of the `AvailBridge` contract added new storage variables to the base contract, a storage layout collision would occur.

VSCode and Manual Review

## Recommendation

Hence it is recommended to append a __gap variable as the last storage variable to the `AvaildBrdige` upgradeable contract, such that the storage slots sum up to a fixed amount (e.g. 50). This will protect the storage layout against any future storage layout changes to the base contract (`AvailBridge`).

Note that the __gap variable space will need to be adjusted accordingly as subsequent versions include more storage variables, in order to maintain the fixed amount of slots (e.g. 50).
