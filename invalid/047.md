# Unauthorized Withdrawal Vulnerability

## Summary
An Attacker / Malicious user can call `withdrawFees` function again and again to drain the contract balance. Although it's only going to recipient address (which can only be controlled my governance), but then the contract will have no balance. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `AvailBridge::withdrawFees` function lacks proper access control, allowing any user to call the function. This oversight poses a critical vulnerability as an attacker or a malicious user could repeatedly invoke this function, leading to a continuous drain of the contract's balance.


## Impact
The vulnerability can result in a complete depletion of the contract's balance, rendering it unable to perform its intended functions. This could disrupt the normal operation of the contract and potentially lead to financial losses for users relying on its functionality.

## Recommendation
 The use of the `onlyRole` modifier with the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` can be an effective measure to restrict access to authorized administrators only.
