# Reverse order of constructor arguments for ERC20 name and symbol

## Summary

`WrappedAvail` inherits from OpenZeppelin's `ERC20` and passes hardcoded strings to the constructor. These are in reverse order, setting the name to the symbol and vice versa.

## Vulnerability Detail

`ERC20` takes name first and symbol second, however in the code these are the opposite way around.

## Impact

The ERC20 name is set to the intended symbol, and the ERC20 symbol is set to the intended name.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
constructor(address _bridge) ERC20Permit("Wrapped Avail") ERC20("WAVAIL", "Wrapped Avail") {
```

## Recommendation

Change the order of constructor arguments.
