# Lack of Reentrancy Protection in Functions Interacting with External Contracts

## Summary
The functions withdrawFees, receiveAVAIL, receiveETH, receiveERC20, and sendERC20 interact with external contracts but do not employ reentrancy protection
## Vulnerability Detail
Functions that transfer funds or interact with external contracts should be protected against reentrancy attacks. Although the current code might not be directly vulnerable, it's generally a good practice to guard these functions against potential reentrancy for contract robustness.
## Impact
Reentrancy attacks can lead to unexpected behavior, allowing potentially malicious entities to exploit the contract logic, potentially leading to loss of funds or corrupted contract state.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Employ the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and consider using a reentrancy guard for functions that alter contract state and are potentially exposed to external calls. OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard can be used to easily implement such protection.
