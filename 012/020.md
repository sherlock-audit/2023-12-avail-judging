# Reentrancy (SWC-107)

## Summary
Reentrancy protection is crucial for functions interacting with external contracts or managing assets, especially in the context of a cross-chain bridge like AvailBridge.
The contract uses ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable for functions involving token transfers, but consistent and correct application is vital to prevent reentrancy attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
Functions that make external calls or transfer assets are susceptible to reentrancy attacks. In the context of AvailBridge, these functions are critical as they handle the bridging of messages and assets between chains. Reentrancy can lead to unexpected behavior, such as double spending or state inconsistencies.
Reentrancy attacks can occur when a contract interacts with external contracts in an unsecured manner, allowing attackers to drain funds or manipulate contract states.

## Impact
Reentrancy can lead to significant fund loss and undermine contract integrity if not properly mitigated, particularly in functions transferring assets.

These functions involve cross-chain message processing and asset transfers and are guarded with whenNotPaused and nonReentrant modifiers to prevent reentrancy attacks.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that all functions interacting with external contracts or handling assets, especially those involved in cross-chain operations, employ the nonReentrant modifier.
